F.I.R.S.T Principles for Automated Tests

Fast - fast feedback loop, run often
Isolated - independent, arbitrary order
Repeatable - same result each time, not flaky
Self-validating - actual vs expected
Timely - with (or even before!) production code // This means, write tests ASAP! IT will be WAY HARDER to understand what's going on later on...
